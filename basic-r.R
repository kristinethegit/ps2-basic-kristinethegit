## ---------- A2: Basic R (variables, vectors, functions) ----------

## -------------------- Set up --------------------
## In this assignment we ask you to use `stringr` package for
## the string functions.
## Read more about it in Wickham & Grolemund "R for Data Science"
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html

## Install the library if needed and load it
## Ensure you don't install the library more than once!


## -------------------- Defining variables --------------------
## Here we ask you to define, compute, and print a number of variables
## ---------- Example: ----------
## Create variable `my_name` that is equal to your first name
my_name <- "Kristine"
cat("I am", my_name, "\n")
## ---------- end of the example ----------


## Create a numeric variable `my_age` that is equal to your age
my_age <- 21

## How many seconds is there in a year?  Compute this number!
## Assign it to a suitably named variable and print the result
## with a informative message
secsinyr <- 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
secsinyr

## What is your age in seconds?  Use the variable 'my_age' you computed
## above and seconds-in-year, and compute it.  Assign the result to a
## suitable named variable
my_age_in_seconds <- 21 * secsinyr
cat("There are", my_age_in_seconds, "seconds in my age", "\n")

## Are you more than 650M seconds old?  Perform such logical operation and
## assign the result to a variable 'I_am_old'.  Print the result with a
## suitable message
##I_am_old <- (650000000 / my_age_in_seconds)
I_am_old <- 650000000 < my_age_in_seconds
cat("I am older than 650M:", I_am_old, "\n")


### How many seconds is a typical human lifetime?
avghumanlife <- 70
cat("avg human life",(avghumanlife * secsinyr), "\n")

### -------------------- Working with functions --------------------

## Write a function called `make_introduction` that takes in two
## arguments: name, and age. 
## This function should return a string value that says something like
## "Hello, my name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old".
## NB!  It should _return_ the string, not print it!
make_introduction <- function(name, age){
  return <- paste("Hello, my name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
}

## Create a variable `my_intro` by passing your variables `my_name` and `my_age`
## into your `make_introduction`
## function.  Always print the result!
my_intro <- make_introduction(my_name, my_age);
my_intro

## Create a variable `casual_intro` by substituting "Hello, my name is ",
## with "Hey, I'm" in your `my_intro`
## variable.  Check out stringr functions
## 'str_replace' and 'str_replace_all'
casual_intro <- str_replace(my_intro, "Hello, my name is ", "Hey, I'm ")
str_replace(my_intro, "Hello, my name is ", "Hey, I'm ")

## Create a new variable `loud_intro`, which is your `my_intro` variable
## in all upper-case letters
loud_intro <- str_replace(my_intro, "Hello, my name is ", "Hey, I'm ")
toupper(casual_intro)
print(toupper(loud_intro)) 

## Using the `str_count` function, create a variable `occurrences` that
## stores the # of times the letter "e"
## appears in `my_intro`
my_intro = "Hello, my name is Kristine and I am 21 years old"
str_count(my_intro, "e")

## Write another function `double` that takes in a (numeric) variable
## and returns that variable multiplied by two
double <- function(x){
  return (x*2);
}
doubleNumE <- double(str_count(my_intro, "e"))
print(doubleNumE)


## Using your `double` function, create a variable `seconds_in_two_years`,
## which is the number of seconds in two years.
## Always print your results!
seconds_in_two_years <- double(secsinyr)
print(seconds_in_two_years)

## Write another function `cube` that takes in a value and returns that value
## cubed
cube <- function(x){
  return (x^3)
}
cubedNum <- cube(3)
cubedNum
## Create a (suitably named) variable by passing the number 3 to your `cube`
## function


## Use for-loop to print cubes of numbers 1..10
## Hint: see course book
# https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/functions.html#for-loops


### ------------------------------ working with vectors ------------------------------

## Create a vector `movies` that contains the names of six movies you like
## Always print your results!

movies <- c("Les Miserables", "Cinema Paradiso", "Green Book", "Amelie", "Ponyo", "Mother!")
movies
## Create a vector `top_three` that only contains the first three movies in the vector.
## Use indexing.
top_three <- c(1, 2, 5)
movies[top_three]

## Using your vector and the paste method, create a vector `excited` that adds the phrase -
## " is a great movie!" to the end of each element in your movies vector
excited <- paste(movies, "is a great movie")

## Create a vector `without_four` that has your first three movies, and your 5th and 6th movies.


## Create a vector `numbers` that is the numbers 70 through 79


## Using the built in length function, create a variable `len` that
## is equal to the length of your vector
## `numbers`


## Using the `mean` function, create a variable `numbers_mean` that
## is the mean of your vector `numbers`


## Create a vector `lower_numbers` that is the numbers 60:69


## Create a vector `all_numbers` that combines your `lower_numbers` and `numbers` vectors
## Ensure the result looks right!


## Which numbers (out of all_numbers) are larger than 70?
## Use logical operations to create a logical
## vector (TRUES/FALSES) that tell which number is larger


## Out of your all numbers, extract only those that are
## smaller than 70


## Compute squares of all those numbers that are smaller
## than 70 in your vector


## Compute modulo by 2 of all your numbers.
## Hint: check out the modulo operator '%%'


## Print even numbers only in your vector.
## Do _not_ create the subvector manually, use modulo operator and logical
## indexing to extract the even numbers!
