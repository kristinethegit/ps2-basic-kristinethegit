# PS02: Basic R

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll work through a set of tasks that require
knowledge of core concepts in R, and review your version control
skills.  More specifically, this project is about:

* Managing a project using git and GitHub
* Creating variables of different types in R
* Writing and executing R functions
* creating and manipulating vectors.

This is mostly about basic coding skills, but vectors are also widely
used tools for data programming.


## Instructions

The instructions are written in file `basic-r.R`.  This is a file that
is set up as R code but it consists almost exclusively of
comments--these are the list of tasks you should achieve.

Your task is to write the corresponding code there after the relevant
question (please leave the question in place).  Ensure your code runs,
and works correctly.  When you test it, you may want to run it a few
lines at time (see the [course book
5.2.2](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/r-intro.html#running-r-rstudio)),
but for final test, ensure that _all of it runs_ (use the _Source_
button in RStudio).

Ensure that your code _produces output_.  In more complex cases, you
may want to use `cat()` or `print()`, in simpler cases you may just
ype the variable name and it will be printed.

Every time you finish a chunk of work (or just take a longer break),
we recommend to
commit and push your changes.


## Submission

When done, I recommend to check your files on github and make sure all
your work are reflected there, and you have pushed the latest version.
You need to submit two things:

* a link to your GH repo for this problem set (exactly as in PS1).
  We recommend you to **submit
  the link** as soon as you have opened your repo.  You can work on the
  repo later, the link will not change.
* copy of your code output: when your code is ready and works
  correctly, execute it in its entirety (_Source-with-echo_ button in
  RStudio, see
  [course book
  5.2.2](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/r-intro.html#running-r-rstudio).)
  Copy the relevant output from RStudio console to canvas text entry
  box!
  
These two things constitute your submission.
Have fun!
